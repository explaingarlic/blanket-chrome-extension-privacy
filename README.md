## GDPR Rights

### Right to Erasure (Right to be forgotten)

You should have full right to access within my application. If you do not, for whatever reason, please email me at the email found on the related application's Chrome Webstore page.

### Right to Access

This will be available as an automated service soon, but for now please use the email present on the Chrome Webstore page.


# How I use your data

## Data Sent to My Server
I record no personal data on my own server, only data used for caching purposes of requests. This may include the links to images or the license plates contained within those images. These requests are not linked to you, nor do I have any method of determining who made one of these requests.

No deletion of this data may be requested, unless it is specifically related to any individual with whom you may prove relation. 

# Third Parties

## Data sent to external oauth provider
I do not record any personal data from an external oauth provider however remain able to view your data - limited to an email address, first and last name in *all* cases. You may provide whatever first and last name you wish, and whatever email address you have access to - I do not discriminate based on real or "fake" users.

Even this small amount of data will *not* be used for promotional purposes, only for purposes of technical support in the case of an issue. I will not reach out to your email address, or any other medium for contact with you, for personal or marketing reasons - only to ask for feedback, to assist with a technical issue noticed on the server-side, or to provide you with *free* special offers that have no promotional value to me whatsoever.

My external oauth provider (currently Kinde) claims full responsibility for the data that it holds. I have zero access to, and responsibility for, your password or other such data.

The oauth provider's privacy policy is found here: https://docs.kinde.com/trust-center/privacy-and-compliance/privacy-policy/

## Processing of Data

Neither I nor my third parties process your data, in any meaningful way. The closest thing is your email being displayed on my Chrome Extension's popup.

## Financial Data, payment data.

I currently use Stripe to handle payments for the services that I provide. As a result of this, I am privy to minimal financial data including the last four digits of a PAN number, or a similarly incomplete verification number for bank accounts or any other payment method used.

The Stripe privacy policy is found here: https://stripe.com/gb/privacy

## Images including license plates

In order to detect license plates I use an external API. Their privacy policy is found here: https://platerecognizer.com/terms-of-use-privacy-policy/
