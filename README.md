# How I use your data

## Data Sent to My Server
I record no personal data on my own server, only data used for caching purposes of requests. This may include the links to images or the license plates contained within those images.

# Third Parties

## Data sent to external oauth provider
I do not record any personal data from an external oauth provider however remain able to view your data - limited to an email address, first and last name in all cases.

Even this small amount of data will *not* be used for promotional purposes, only for purposes of technical support in the case of an issue. I will not reach out to your email address, or any other, for personal or marketing reasons - only to ask for feedback or to assist with a technical issue noticed on the server-side.

My external oauth provider claims full responsibility for the data that it holds (currently Kinde).

The oauth provider's privacy policy is found here: https://docs.kinde.com/trust-center/privacy-and-compliance/privacy-policy/

## Financial Data, payment data.

I currently use Stripe to handle payments for the services that I provide. As a result of this, I am privy to minimal financial data including the last four digits of a PAN number, or a similarly incomplete verification number for bank accounts or any other payment method used.

The Stripe privacy policy is found here: https://stripe.com/gb/privacy

## Images including license plates

In order to detect license plates I use an external API. Their privacy policy is found here: https://platerecognizer.com/terms-of-use-privacy-policy/
